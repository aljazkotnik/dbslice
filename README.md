This is a branch of the original dbslice project (https://github.com/grahampullan/dbslice).

This fork is a WIP to recreate dbslice in a reactive environment, make the interactive version of it more modular, and update some of it's core functionality and styling.



Getting the minimal working example going:
- Download the repository
- in it's folder initialise a local server. Install the 'http-server' package from 'npm' locally in this folder, or install it globally. Then initialise the server by e.g. 'http-server -p 1234'. 
- Open a browser, and type 'localhost/examples/comp3rwo/index.html' into the address bar, and the example should appear.
