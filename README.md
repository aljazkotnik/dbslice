# dbslice
**dbslice** is a JavaScript library for web-based data exploration. A collection of data instances (Tasks)  can be interactively filtered, based on high-level descriptors, to obtain a selection of Tasks for deeper exploration. The selected Tasks are then compared using scatter, line, contour and 3D surface plots, generated on demand.

**dbslice** is built on the [d3.js](https://d3js.org) , [crossfilter.js](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter) and [three.js](https://threejs.org) libraries.
